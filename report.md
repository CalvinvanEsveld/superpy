These are the 3 technical elements that I find notable:

1. The plotting section of the function profit, revenue and profit_revenue, which creates a graph of 
profit, revenue or profit and revenue over a period of time. This is because it outputs something visible 
to the user. The plotting section uses the data processed in the earlier parts of the code to create a visual 
representation of the information.

`plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')    
 plt.plot(sorted_dates, (list(map(float, list1))))    
 plt.xlabel('Days')
 plt.ylabel('(EURO)')
 plt.title(total_profit)
 plt.show()`

2. Is the use of two nested loops to iterate over the rows of two separate CSV files. This allows the 
program to compare the data from each file and calculate the profit for each product sold during the 
specified period. I think this is a good approach because it allows for a flexible and scalable solution 
to calculating profit, regardless of the size of the CSV files or the number of products sold during the 
specified period. The if statements within the nested loops to filter the data and only include 
rows that meet certain criteria to ensure that the program only calculates profit for the relevant data.

`for row1 in data1:
    for row2 in data2:
        if row1[1][:7] == period: 
            if row1[0] == row2[0]:
                sub = float(row1[2]) - float(row2[4])
                list1.append(sub)
                dates.append(row1[1][5:])
        elif row1[1] == period: 
            if row1[0] == row2[0]:
                sub = float(row1[2]) - float(row2[4])
                list1.append(sub)`


3. The df_to_table function call from the rich_tools module. This function solves the problem of converting 
a pandas DataFrame into a formatted table that can be printed using the rich module. The reason I think this 
implementation is great is because it provides an easy way to display data in a readable and visually appealing 
format. Additionally, the df_to_table function handles the formatting and conversion of the DataFrame to a table, 
making the code much cleaner and easier to read. Overall, this implementation is a great example of how 
libraries and modules can be combined to solve a common problem in a efficient way.

`data = pd.read_csv("report.csv")
 table = df_to_table(data)
 return print(table)`
